# Particle-Swarm-Optimization
An implementation of PSO algorithm to find a Solution which Minimizes A general Cost Function
In this Example THe cost Function is A sphere Function (Finding Magnitude on N-Dimensional Vector), and PSO aims to find A location where this Cost function is minimum within A given Search space only, defined by VarMin and VarMax.
